    "Statistics is a field of maths that deals with the collection, analysis, explanation and presentation of data. Statistical methods can be used to find solutions to problems which contain numerical data. These mathematical formulas or Statistical methods used to find solutions are known as quantitative models. Thus, we can define Statistics as a branch of mathematics which uses different quantitative models to produce a solution for a real-world problem containing numerical data. Statistics can be used to  solve real-world complex problems using data. Knowledge of Statistics can help a person to draw some very interesting inferences from data. \n",

    "Data is a term that we usually hear these days, in today’s modern world data is among one of the most common terms that is being used by people in their day to day life. Enormous amount of data is being generated by people all around the world on a daily basis. Now for some people this data is useless but for some it is as valuable as gold. Data Scientists use this unstructured data to find some really interesting inferences which can help their companies in many ways. Example using data to specifically target a particular audience, using data for early detection of diseases, using data for political campaigns etc. These are some of the real-world scenarios in which data is being used to enhance the outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "But finding these inferences isn’t an easy job, the data that we gather is unstructured and requires a lot of pre-processing. Only after preprocessing the data can this data be used for visualizations and training models. Here statistics comes into play, having a good knowledge of statistics can help a programmer in various steps of Data Analysis.\n",

    "It can be used in data pre-processing, for example seeing the unstructured data an analyst can determine whether to drop the rows which don't contain any value (NaN rows) or to fill them with mean, mode etc (Statistical methods).\n",

    "Some of the key applications of statistics in data science include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Descriptive statistics: It is a set of statistical techniques that are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. This includes measures of central tendency (such as the mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (such as the range and standard deviation), and measures of distribution (such as histograms and frequency tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Central tendency measures are used to describe the typical or average value of a dataset. For example, the mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in the dataset. Variability measures, on the other hand, describe how spread out the data is. For example, the standard deviation measures how much the values in the dataset differ from the mean. Distribution measures provide information on how the data is distributed across the range of possible values. For example, a histogram can be used to show how many data points fall into each range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Inferential Statistics:  This involves making inferences about a population based on a sample of data, using techniques such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing involves making a statement about a population parameter (such as the population mean) and testing whether the sample data supports or contradicts that statement. A null hypothesis is proposed, which assumes that there is no significant difference between the population parameter and the sample statistic. The sample data is then analyzed to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected or not.\n",
    "\n",
    " Confidence intervals are another inferential statistical technique used to estimate population parameters. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would be a range of values that is expected to contain the true population mean with 95% confidence.\n",
